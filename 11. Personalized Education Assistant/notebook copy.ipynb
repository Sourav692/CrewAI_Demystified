    "## 🎓 Key Concepts Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components Used\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Process Sequential**\n",
    "Tasks are executed in a defined order, with each task potentially using the output of previous tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "crew = Crew(\n",
    "    agents=[...],\n",
    "    tasks=[task1, task2, task3],\n",
    "    process=Process.sequential  # Key setting\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Pydantic Structured Outputs**\n",
    "Define the exact shape of agent outputs using Pydantic models:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LearningMaterials(BaseModel):\n",
    "    topic: str\n",
    "    resources: List[LearningResource]\n",
    "\n",
    "task = Task(\n",
    "    ...,\n",
    "    output_json=LearningMaterials,  # Structured output\n",
    "    output_file=\"output.json\"  # Saved to file\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Custom Tools**\n",
    "Create domain-specific tools by extending `BaseTool`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ProjectSuggestionTool(BaseTool):\n",
    "    name: str = \"Project Suggestion Tool\"\n",
    "    description: str = \"...\"\n",
    "    args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = ProjectSuggestionInput\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _run(self, topics: str, expertise_level: str) -> str:\n",
    "        # Tool logic here\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Task Context**\n",
    "Pass information between tasks using the `context` parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "quiz_task = Task(\n",
    "    ...,\n",
    "    context=[learning_materials_task]  # Uses output from previous task\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏋️ Try It Yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with the following modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Change Topics**: Try different subjects like \"Web Development\", \"Data Science\", \"Cloud Computing\"\n",
    "2. **Adjust Expertise Level**: Switch between \"beginner\", \"intermediate\", and \"advanced\"\n",
    "3. **Add More Agents**: Create a \"Study Schedule Agent\" that creates a weekly learning plan\n",
    "4. **Enhance the Quiz**: Add different question types (true/false, fill-in-the-blank)\n",
    "5. **Improve Project Tool**: Add industry-specific project templates\n",
